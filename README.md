Welcome! 
================================
THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE REACT APP!
----------------------------------
The app is using react - version 18.2.0

You will need to install certain dependencies using the npm install command in the terminal.

npm install react-router-dom@6.22.3 react-bootstrap@2.10.2 bootstrap@5.3.3

After doing so you can use the 'npm run dev' command and the app should start up in the given url

Once in the app you will be able to see a list of contacts. This contacts can be clicked on to display more details.

There will also be a product list with the button that can remove products from the list. 

Below the list there will be a form that allows the user to submit more products that will show up on the list once submitted.

And that is all there really is to it!
